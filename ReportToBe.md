Model of Organization â€“ To Be



# Summary of changes

Essity is a growing company focused on staying closer to customers and, at the same time, on reducing their environmental impact. To better meet these goals, even thought both processes analyzed are well organized, we think that it is possible to set up new functionalities in order to improve the planning of activities as well as to increase customers satisfaction.

Indeed, both processes, row material check and product design, have some problems: 
- in the "production design" process the comunications between customer and company and between different department of the same company is based on email: customer send a request to the customer service via email, which fills a new request and sends it to the Altopascio competence center, again, via email ect. Moreover, customers have no feedback on the status of the request and, after they have submitted it, they can't give feedback on the proof apart from accepted/rejected.
Furthermore we believe that the process of request (customer make a request - graphic department give a feedback) has more steps than necessary, and so it could be accelerated.
- in the "row material check" process every time a order arrives, it must be checked if the row material are sufficient, otherwise the order can't be satisfied untill the arrival of new raw materials. Checking row material everytime a order arrives can cause a block on the production and possibly a delay in the delivery date.

We think that these problems can be solved by introducing two applications, one B2C and one B2B: the B2B app will be used to semi-automate the process of row material checking, which will notify employees when new material needs to be ordered, while the B2C application will fully automate the request for a new order, enabling in-app communication instead of the use of emails.

The new process is managed by an application that allows the automatization of the order request and the check of the state by the customer. For these reasons an account is required for both user and employee as even the workers will access the order information via the app.

Furthermore, it's now possible for the customers to add comments while approving or rejecting the proof and a design feasibility will be attached to each request, even when the request is rejected by the "Altopascio competence center".

## Functional view, processes

Write no change if the model remains as in As Is

### Process selection

Report the PICK chart (see process redesign chapter)  used to select the process to be changed and argument about it

### Process 1

The main problem we found in the As-Is product design process was the number of steps required to fufill a simple request to the Graphic's department. The End customer had to first contact the Essity Customer Service, then the CS had to contact the Altopascio competence center's Product service department, who would have to record in a database the requests to keep track of them. At this point the PS department could contact the Graphic's department and ask for the check and the proof realization. 
All these communications were done by email, so the process was bound to create difficulties in case of an human error (employee fails to send email) and it could take a great amount of time, especially if we consider that a product design can be sent back many times before the final approval. 

We can fix these problems using a specific application that gives direct contact between the End Customer and the Graphic's department. When the EC finished the product design example, he can upload it to the application using a specific request form and notify the Graphic's department, who can at that point start the procedure to check the feasibility of the design. All the communications and the feedback between the two entities can be done through the application, who will send a specific notification every time, and are stored in the application's database.

Every End Customer and Graphic's department employee has an account on the application, with specific privileges depending on their role in the process. The End Customer can check the state of the procedure in the application by logging into the page dedicated to the specific process.
The Essity Customer Service department's employees also have accounts to manage eventual assistance requests from the End Customers.

### Process 2

In the As-Is process the Planning Department has to check the raw material stock for every order received. If the materials are not enough to fufill the order, the department has to get in touch directly with the suppliers and reject the order while it waits for the Production facility to replenish their stock. This is a problem because it loses the company a lot of time waiting for the raw materials and it makes them postpone orders. 
To fix this problem we thought the Production Facility could implement its own checking process for the stock. 
Every material in the facility gets scanned manually with a bar code scanner and is recorded on the application so that we can keep track of the materials that exit the warehouse. The stock is checked by a production department employee through the application every day, and if it gets under a certain threshold the application manages the order request for the suppliers. After the supplier notifies the shipping of the raw materials, the production facility stock gets replenished. 
The application has an inventory of the products for the warehouse that are associated with a specific barcode. It also has an account for the suppliers and the production facility to manage the communications between them, for example when the production facility needs to order new material. 
In the application it's also possible to modify the stock's threshold.

## IT view

### Application portfolio

Basically the organization, continues to use the same application portfolio as in As Is situation but in the To Be situation, two new applications are introduced: CAPP (Customer Application) and CRW (Check Row material application).

We have reported below the description about only these two new applications.

| Application name | Vendor (or internal if made internally) | Main functions |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| CAPP | internal back-end / external front-end | This application is used to manage with more automation and without some intermediate steps the interaction between the graphic department and the customer |
| CRW | internal back-end / external front-end | This application is used to check each time a raw material exits the warehouse the remaining availability of that item. The application is so used to notificate the planning department on when a new order has to be done |

#### Selection

The two new applications introduced have to be developed custom for the company.

In particular, we thought that according to the IT strategy, it would be better for the company to outsource only the front-end development of the two applications. 

As a matter of fact, the core business of the company is not to develop software and so, relying on external developers should be less expensive in terms of time and money and also allows the company to continue focusing resources and employees on the same objectives of the As Is situation but, on the other hand, these applications, should manage a lot of sensible informations and then, it would be better if the back-end development of the applications, based on aspects like privacy and security of users, is managed and developed internally.

#### Coverage

Show how the selected application provides the software functions needed (as identified in Functional view, processes section), discuss gaps, if any

| Software function needed (from process view) | Software function provided by application selected | Gap analysis |

### Technological view
![DeploymentDiagramTOBE](Images/DeploymentDiagramTOBE.jpg)

The new Deployment Diagram highlights the introduction of the new applications.
The first one that manage the customer relationship from the assistance to the creation of a new order with a dedicated interface for draft approval. 
The second one concerns the orders for raw materials with the introduction of bar code scanner and the related bar code for the products.

#### Integration

In case a new application is introduced discuss how integration happens in terms of

Data exchange (which data is exchanged)

Control mechanism (mechanism used by applications to interact, ex message passing, rpc, etc)

# IT strategy

Applications development is not Essity's core business and hiring resources to develop them is not a necessary effort for the company. This is why the choice to entrust the development of the app to a specialized external company makes sense and allows the IT office to focus on the security of the customer's data, which remains internalized.

On the other hand, the introduction of a new application follows the Business Strategy of creating values, in this case, for the customer. Therefore, the IT department will likely need a reorganization in order to meet new demands on data management.


# Effect of change(s)

## Effect on KPIs and CSFs

| Indicator (Csf, Kpi) name | Effect | Quantitative estimate of variation (absolute, %) |
| --- | --- | :---: |
|  CSF1: Customer Satsifation |  Increase because the customers have more managment and user-friendly with the app  | 20% |
|CSF3|The customer service manage the comunication with the customer in a better way with a GUI and trough the app | 30% |
|CSF3.1|The response time (to process a new request from a EC and give to it a feedback) decrease thanks to the good realization of the all infrastructure around the new managment software | 20% |
|CSF5|The number of merged orders can increase thanks to an algorithm| 15% |
|CSF9: Time from check stock of raw materials to order new materials or confirm planned SAP order|The process time has an important decrease because the app automatically manage if a new order is needed  | 40% |
| N_ECS | Could decrease a little because few employees belonging to the customer service could be assigned to other departments  | 5% |
| LT_R | It decreases thanks to the CAPP application. Time for realizing the proof still depends on the graphic department but intermediate steps and useless losses of time are avoided | 30% |
| T_C1, UC_O | They decrease because thanks to the CAPP, effort of employees belonging to the customer service and Altopascio competence center decreases. Costs for software licences of outsourced applications remain the same | 20% |
| N_EPD | Could decrease a little because few employees belonging to the planning department could be assigned to other departments | 5% |
| T_CH | Thanks to automation introduced by the CRW app it should become zero | 100% |
| T_C2, UC_O | They decrease a little because thanks to the CRW app, effort of planning department employees decreases. Effort of employees belonging to other departments and costs for software licences of outsourced applications remain the same | 10% |
| C_S | It increases thanks to the more efficient service offered by the customer service + CAPP | 10% |


## TCO, ROI and Break even

| Phase | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Construction C | Acquisition or development of new physical and IT infrastructure |
| Deployment D | Training of employees, installation of bar code readers, deployment of new software and IT functions |
| Operation O | Electricity, conditioning, effort of employees |
| Maintenance M | Maintenance of physical and IT infrastructure |
| Dismissal DIS | Uninstall applications, infrastructure dismissal and data porting to new IT infrastructure |

Assuming:
- **5 years horizon**
- Dismissal phase after 5 years
- **C+D** = 35000â‚¬, **O+M** = 3000â‚¬, **S** = 13000â‚¬

|  | **Year1** | **Year2** | **Year3** | **Year4** | **Year5** |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Cost** | C,D,O,M | O,M | O,M | O,M | O,M |
| **Saving** | SV | SV | SV | SV | SV |
| **Total** | -25000â‚¬ | -15000â‚¬ | -5000â‚¬ | 5000â‚¬ | 15000â‚¬ |

 - The majority of savings(SV) depends on the lower costs related to the effort of employees

- Assuming the costs we reported above, the break-even point is reached at the fourth year

## Risks

The main risks are related to the human factor, in fact, it is possible that employees may not agree to learn how to use the new softwares, or, it is possible that they could take a long time to do it and also do it badly. In addition, the customer may also reject the changes as he doesn't like the new system.

There could be other risks related to the technological factor, as a matter of fact, although the back-end development of the applications is done internally and the company has the whole control on privacy and security of data, the front-end developers of the applications, could make some mistakes implementing wrong functionalities or misintrepreting the defined requirements.

These risks could make the whole process less efficient and definitely, the company has to keep under control all these aspects, for instance, trying as much as possible to introduce the new functions into the system gradually or trying to invest an appropriate amount of time on training of employees.
